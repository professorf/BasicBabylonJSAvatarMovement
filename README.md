A Quick Sample of Basic Avatar Movement Control in Babylon.JS WebGL

I'm creating a bunch of very simple tutorials of using Babylon.JS to create virtual worlds and indy games.

You MUST upload all files to a web server in order to run them.

This uses the Dude model, which is from Microsoft's XNA sample library.
